Hello, there 

This is just a excercise to learn the react framework and look what's possible with this.

I'm mainly going to follow along the video tutorial from the channel "net ninja" 

here's a link if you're interested to see what tutorial I'm following:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D1x7-2FmTA&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d&index=3

to get the nodemodules folder for this react app enter in the terminal:
npm install

I have some understanding problems with outputting lists of #10, And also how functions are beeing overgiven to other functions using "functions as Props" from video nr 13
